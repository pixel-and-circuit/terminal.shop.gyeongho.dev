# Contracts: 002-responsive-terminal-layout

This feature does **not** introduce new API endpoints or request/response contracts.

- **Scope**: TUI-only changes (centering, loading screen, resize handling). No new HTTP or backend APIs.
- **Existing API**: Backend API contracts remain as defined in [001-ssh-shop-tui/contracts/](../001-ssh-shop-tui/contracts/) (e.g. `openapi.yaml`).

No OpenAPI or other contract files are added in this feature.
