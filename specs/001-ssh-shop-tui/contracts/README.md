# API Contracts: shop.gyeongho.dev

**Base URL**: `https://shop.gyeongho.dev/api`  
**Feature**: 001-ssh-shop-tui

The TUI client calls these endpoints. Until the server exists, the client uses an abstract interface and mock implementations; this directory defines the future API shape for alignment and contract tests.

See [openapi.yaml](./openapi.yaml) for the formal contract.
