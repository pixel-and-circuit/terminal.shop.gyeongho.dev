> A nostalgic terminal-based shopping experience for dad's mushroom farm.

Project governance and principles (code quality, testing, UX/UI consistency, model-first design, quality gates) are defined in [.specify/memory/constitution.md](.specify/memory/constitution.md).

## Inspiration

Inspired by [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop), this project brings the charm of retro terminal interfaces to my father's mushroom farm back home. Because buying mushrooms should be more fun than scrolling through a boring web page!
